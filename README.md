# E-commerce Recommendation System Project 🌐❤️

## Overview 📊

This project implements an **E-commerce Recommendation System** that analyzes transactional data to generate frequent itemsets and derive association rules using the **Apriori Algorithm**. It provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Features 🔎

- **Frequent Itemset Mining**: Discover frequent item combinations from transactional data.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Generate actionable rules based on metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of large datasets with cleaning and one-hot encoding.
- **Sampling for Scalability**: Implemented sampling to overcome memory limitations for large datasets.

## Workflow 🎮

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Removed missing values and irrelevant columns.
   - Generated one-hot encoded data for transactions.

2. **Frequent Itemset Generation**:
   - Used the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold.

3. **Association Rule Mining**:
   - Derived association rules with metrics such as lift and confidence.
   - Filtered rules to identify the most impactful patterns.

4. **Scalability Solution**:
   - Sampled the dataset to handle memory constraints efficiently.

## Key Metrics 🔢

- **Support**: Frequency of itemsets in transactions.
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of consequent given antecedent.
- **Lift**: Strength of association between items.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Mlxtend, Matplotlib

## Results 🏆

- Identified frequent itemsets and meaningful association rules.
- Optimized processing of large datasets through sampling techniques.
- Improved understanding of customer purchase patterns.

## Challenges & Solutions ⚔️

- **Memory Constraints**: Addressed by implementing a sampling mechanism to process smaller subsets of the dataset.
- **Data Sparsity**: Utilized one-hot encoding and grouped transactions for meaningful analysis.

## Future Improvements 🌐

- Implement collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- Use advanced algorithms like FP-Growth for faster frequent pattern mining.
- Incorporate visualization dashboards to present insights interactively.

## Acknowledgments 🙏
